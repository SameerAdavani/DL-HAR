Time series Analyses for Deep Learning based Human Activity Recognition

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a field of study that focuses on the spontaneous recognition of
people’s daily routine activities by utilizing time series recordings made using sensors( 1 ). We are
using labelled data from basketball players’ activities in our HAR investigation

# Data Pre-Processing
The data for all the players is imported. This data is first cleaned. The cleaning process includes
removing not_labelled values, correcting incorrect labels.
